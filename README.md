LEGv8 CPU Design & FPGA Implementation

Description:
Designed and implemented a functional LEGv8 CPU in Verilog with datapath, control unit, and register file. Created testbenches to verify instruction execution and deployed the design on a Basys 3 FPGA, successfully demonstrating correct execution of multiple instructions.
